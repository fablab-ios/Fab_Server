ABOUT FABLAB:

An incubator for ideas and a place to engage people’s imaginations,
the UVM FabLab makes rapid-prototyping tools available to UVM students and faculty.
The lab provides the opportunity for interaction in developing and testing innovative
products and designs.We encourage projects that support research, innovation and creativity,
and student work that is supported by coursework and professors.

The UVM FabLab is funded by the College of Engineering and
Mathematical Sciences with support from the Office of the Vice President for Research.

In 2015 we received new lab furniture and work stations thanks to a
generous donation from Production Basics, Inc.
